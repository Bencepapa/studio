## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Purple (#BE29EC) for a modern and vibrant look, reminiscent of digital interfaces and cyber themes.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#2B2B2B) provides a high-contrast backdrop, allowing the effects to pop and ensuring transparency is clearly visible.
- Accent color: Neon Green (#39FF14) used for highlights and interactive elements, drawing the user's eye to important controls and customizable aspects of the effects.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif with a modern and technical feel, is used for headlines and body text to complement the app's visual effects.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' will display paths and filenames clearly.
- Effects displayed full-screen with an unobtrusive control panel.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for control functions. The icons should follow a monochrome style using the accent color.
- Smooth transitions between effects in the preview environment.
